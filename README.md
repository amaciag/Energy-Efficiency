# Energy Efficiency

With a dramatic increase in commercial buildings’ energy consumption over the past years, consequences such as energy shortages and carbon emissions threatening our living environment have been common to us. Therefore, building energy efficiency can provide solutions to address those issues and mitigate the negative impact of the high demand energy consumption. It is important to identify buildings that are energy-inefficient to reduce the carbon footprint and rising prices of energy. The given dataset contains information about buildings’ monthly consumption of energy and their characteristics. I applied machine learning techniques such as clustering to group unlabelled data and a decision tree regression to estimate a benchmark for the energy consumption.
